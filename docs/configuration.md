# Configuration

Configuration of PolarRouteServer works with environment variables. You can either set these directly or from a `.env` file. An example `.env` file is included in the repo as `env.example`.

Environment variables used directly by the Django site are prefixed wit `POLARROUTE_` and those which configure Celery are prefixed with `CELERY_`.

## Mesh settings

- `POLARROUTE_MESH_DIR` - absolute path to directory where mesh files will be made available (this location is periodically checked in production and new files ingested into the database based on the metadata file). A warning is logged in production if this is not set.
- `POLARROUTE_MESH_METADATA_DIR` - as above, absolute path to directory where mesh metadata files will be made available. If this is not set, the value of `POLARROUTE_MESH_DIR` is used and a warning to this effect is logged.
